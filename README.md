Using Natural Language Processing to analyze the lyrics of songs across 4 music genres: rap, r&b, pop and rock.

## About the Data

The dataset is the [Genius Song Lyrics]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information?resource=download") by the user 'carlosgdcj' from Kaggle.

The dataset comprises of language-annotated lyric data, spanning 5 "tags" (genres). The dataset is said to build upon the 5 Million Song Lyrics Dataset, and itself contains approximately 7.88m unique records (based on the `id` column).

For the sake of saving repo capacity (the full dataset is over 9GB), I have only included - and performed my notebook analysis on - a subset of this dataset. This subset comprises of 10000 records from each of the analyzed genres, and was separated via script. If you wish to find and test on the entire dataset, please find the dataset [here]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information?resource=download").

A scalable pipeline to process all the songs of the four identified tags will also be developed, to provide an more comprehensive result. However, the initial purpose is to provide a workable and demonstrate-able workflow of the solution and its outcomes; to better understand how the workflow can be refined and to evaluate the outcomes of the operation and its uses.
