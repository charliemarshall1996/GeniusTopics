    "    - Strip punctuation. This will remove non-alphanumeric characters from the lyrics.\n",
    "    - Strip white space. This will remove double-spaces, returns, tabs from the lyrics.\n",
    "    - Strip stop words. This will remove words within the lyrics that are not conducive to the task of topic modelling.\n",
    "- Normalization\n",
    "    - Normalize case. This will ensure all equivalent alphanumeric characters (and words) are directly comparable.\n",
    "    - Lemmatization. This will transform words to their english 'root' word, therefore allowing words with similar or same definitions to be given a singular identifying word, thus making it easier to process and better to analyze in the task of topic modelling.\n",
