With the goons I spar, stay in tune with ma (What up?)
She like, ""Damn, this the realest since 'Kumbaya'""
Bomaye, Killa Cam, my Lord (My Lord)
Still the man with the pan, scrilla, fam, on board
Now bitches, they want to neuter me, niggas, they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihan's, maneuvering's nothing new to me
Doggy, I'm from the land of grind, pan-pan: gram or dime?
Not toes or MC when I say ""hammer time""
Beef: I hammer mine, when I get my hands on nines
If I had on 'Bama line, Corduroys, Cam'll shine
Canary burgundy: I call it ""Lemon Red"" (Red)
Yellow diamonds in my ear, call 'em ""Lemonheads""
Lemonhead, end up dead, ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone, Flintstones, you could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy, scrappy? (What's going on, Scrappy?)
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm ""Tacky Daddy,"" Range look like Laffy Taffy

Yo, I'm from where Nicky Barnes got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens then were pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both, who am I to fuck tradition up? (Killa!)
So I parked in a tow-away zone
Chrome...I don't care
That car a throwaway, homes (Killa!)
Welcome to Harlem, where you welcome to problems
Off of furlough, fellow felons get pardons
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sings
That when the toolie sing!
Bang! Bang!
Came from that movie ring
Snap, crack jewelry bling
Flapjack, ooh he bring
Clack-clack, ""ooh he ring!""
Bad rap, cuties cling
Ass cap, put them in the river
I'm the sushi king
And I'ma keep ya fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh

How dope is this?
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want: coke or piff?
Got it all, smoke or sniff? (everything)
And you know my drift
Used to figures, dough and shit (millions)
You a rooster nigga, just a roaster, bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci, Louis and Pucci men
Escada, Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's-eye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs, it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes

Can I Live,rap,JAY-Z,1996,468624,{},"[Produced by Irv Gotti]

[Intro]
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

[Verse 1]
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas
[Chorus]
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Verse 2]
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
""Let's do this,"" it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?

[Chorus]
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?",3,en,en,en
Forgive Me Father,rap,Fabolous,2003,4743,{},"Maybe cause I'm eatin
And these bastards fiend for they grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leanin on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they puttin Vaseline on they hubs
I'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I move as smooth as castor cream in the club
And dont pass my green or my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tag and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls of some liquor
Gotta pull it on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

[Hook]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that theres been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again
[Verse 2]
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the scope its gonna blam
The infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
Thats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire
Gettin stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop dimes bigger than Chris Rock front teeth
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup
Of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)",4,en,en,en

Ugh, Killa!
Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers, I legislated; the nerve, I never hated
On murders, premeditated—absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck your ace, take your girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa, so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa 'cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now, the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior; Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina; put your legs behind your head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's Pet Sematary
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was ""Touch Me, Tease Me"" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', oww!

Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

Ugh, Killa, yo, yo, ayo—
You dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice your face, you're it!
It's I who come by, drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky-blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her—""Hi, boo, how you?
Pony skin Louie? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good, ma—I fly too""
Now, a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just your picture, though; you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the four
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Ugh, Killa!

They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna

She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help

Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang

If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it—remix!

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
​iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex

I'm not you, Pusha

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow clear ya sinus 'til the snot drop out
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots, A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

[Verse 3: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clowns?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, ""Wow, that didn't look like my man""
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin
Half static and face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and, I didn't give em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on em, pressed the 40 up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
The coffin the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain ""Super Nigga,"" I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men

Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest
No sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love getting slept on
Cause I'm rawer than dope, fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor?
You wouldn't understand, cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

[Verse 5: Malice]
Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, ""No, I move coke"" (uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)

Man I spit that pimp talk, you hang out where the pimps collide
It's a pimp in my ride, no need to pimp the ride
This ain't the pimp camp: pimp limp, pimp stance
Pimp-slap a slim tramp, order steak, shrimp scamp
Ok-k-kay, you g-g-gay
I'll soufflé ya toupée and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay, or where you stayed
That .45 trey deuce spade sprayed, you stayed
Unload the click-clack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times Square...I got dimes here
By the Port Authority, but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri, checks she forge 'em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story: her daughter applaud me

Bitches might burn you; they runnin' with that clap too

Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder

On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash

December 4th,rap,JAY-Z,2003,283714,{},"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on
[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...",15,en,en,en

With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart

A while back, I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark

I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest

You on some tag-along, flunky yes-man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no, fuck it, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel, fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal, then that bitch is a fool
How come? You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, 'fore I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'mma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like ""Dammit, this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
[Verse 2]
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo, check it, yo, my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you, but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'mma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that?
Yo, I’m not in the mood, son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’mma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smoking
My album is done, so no, there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week, bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
'Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with—fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal Street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take?
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fucking chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’mma take you out your misery
And after this, nigga
Put you in the social study book 'cause you’re history",16,en,en,en

He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Malice]
I heard they snitching on a player; man, say it ain't so
Even as a young'un', they consigned me to blow
Which explains why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an eighth to an O
Word in the streets that the envy is me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
Nine on the waist, hit the bitch up severely
I'm known for the flip of that cocaína
I'm heavy in the street like the 7-Serie' Beemer, man
Hit 'em with the Nina, man
Or that four-fit', guaranteed to lean your man, whoa!
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit you just to make a statement, bitch
Clipse and Cash Money—who ain't rich?
Don't compare me to you, nigga; you ain't this, whoa!

Stunna and Patty Cake, the worldwide pusher (Let's get this money, nigga! Let's get this money!)
Birdman, nigga, leave the guns in the bushes
Been shitting up bricks, unload 'em to Gussy (Cuff 'em up, light 'em up, bitch)
Boss of the ghetto with the round-shape cookie
Shit one, throw one, nigga, flood the block
If I don't go to jail, nigga, birds gon' flock (Brrr! Brrr!)
Nigga sitting on the toilet, bitch, get off the pot!
The bird just landed so the hood gonna rock
New whips, big chips, the Prada-Gucci shit
Bought mami a fly Benz, the wide, skinny lips
She takes my flight, she holds my weight
While the Port was staked out from state to state
It ain't nothing to a baller, baby
Pay the cost, big money, heavyweight, Birdman, hood boss, baby
Stepping on my line, I'll show a little something
Make Corleone come out and the black crow'll touch you

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Ugh! Another soul lost
Had to make his shirt match my oxblood-colored Porsche
Ugh! The rims match, of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them
Glistening, wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm, a gorgeous killer
I put this on my Lord:
My niece was four when she felt chinchilla
I passed the chauffeur that shit
That made fiends rise from the dead like ""Thriller""
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreaming, kick my feet up
Gun poked my waist, remind me of my demon, so
Quit your yappin' before I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix-and-matchin', fella

Yo, show closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hovah

Game spitter, Range sitter, Bentley driver nigga
Keep a full clip, I have to empty out on niggas
Ho bagger, no slacker, get this shit jumping
Like eight blacks, four crackers, get your ass jumped
Cris' sipper, six dipper, wrist glitter nigga
Gat buster, ass toucher.. clit licker
Go against Jigga your ass is dense
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cents?
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out
Hova's like Noah keep two in the truck
I'm like U-Haul; every bitch moving I fuck
You move slut, I gotta put two in your butt
I'm everything: the when's, why's, who's, and what

Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
Hits in a row like MJ; ""Hee-hee!""
Since I was waist height, late night, busting in the clouds
Running wild, coming home late, cussing out my mouth
Niggas said, ""Bryan leave your cousin in the house""
Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out
While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros
Dipping the po-po, getting that dough-dough
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid
What's in the bank? Shoot it
Lose it like I ain't do it
You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank, fluid?
Got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
I clap steel, act ill, Jigga shoot thee
Give you chest pains, leg sprains—absolutely! What!

Try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
Six shell casings found round your shirt

Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up

Losing Weight Pt. 2,rap,Cam'ron,2002,32712,"{""Cam\\'ron"",""Juelz Santana""}","[Chorus: Cam'ron]
Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a car, new estate
Nah, fuck it get the beef and brocs: blue and gray
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Killa never let the drama slide
Y'all gon' hear a nigga momma die
Yell out ""homicide""

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, 18 months? Please, that ain't facing time
I'm stressed anyway, need it for vacation time
I'ma do the right thing though, take shock anyway
6 months, right back on the damn block anyway
But look, money from across the street
Think it's sweet, think he get money across the street
Me and my peeps often meet
And 5-0 they work for us, walk the beat
Walk with heat 'cause talk is cheap
So dun stay silent
Revolvers, automatics, guns stay silent
When it comes to beef it becomes a talent
Remember me, ODB, I'm the one from Violence, Killa
Digital ten, shit get critical friend
I got 800 invisible men
That mean it could be the bank-man
Person at the gas station filling up your tank, fam
Lady at the frank stand'll
Rat poison your relish right in the center, babe
Bitch is a renegade, she'll piss in your lemonade!
And y'all dead now
That you can bet now
Do like a toaster put your bread down
Upset now, hate when I gotta rep, clowns, blow TEC rounds
In a collision, I see their ambition
But they don't know them days I was stooped up and pitching
Or all them hot summers I was cooped up in the kitchen
When it came to grams it was 90 I fried
350 on the stove and it's 90 outside
I'ma get this girl that be stuffing my bricks
Felt life cheated her, she be cutting her wrists
Her mom died, her-on overdose stuffed in her wrist
Father fucking her, older man fucking her sis
But love my music, say I do nothing but hits
She'll do anything for me, nothing but hits
'Cause when she needed help I got her nothing but fixed
Needed coke, needed dope, yeah, I gave her a fix
So she went across the street, gave him a kiss
Stuck her tongue out, flirted, played with his dick
""You know Cam?"" He said, ""yeah"", ""Don't play with his chips""
Stood back, blazed him with 6, amazing and shit
Huh, Killa, Killa, Dipset nigga
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yo, fuck losing weight
We back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Take my moms, move away
Yeah, I think I'ma cop me that new estate
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny

Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me
Until the shots get me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Niggas wanna know why I'm so nice
When it comes to spitting that fire, it's real dog, I live in the fire
Used to being in the streets homie, in the midst of the fire
Break work, put it in pots, sit it in fire
Quick to grab the fifth and just fire
Try to peel off, I'm hitting your tires
Hittin' your door while your car's spinning, hitting the wall
That's just the beginning of war
I let you know you dealing with dogs
My villains'll finish you off
Head in your chest, brain-
Dead on the Van Wyck expressway
While I got my hand in the TEC, wave
Niggas like ""fuck, is he stupid?"" (Yes I am)
Cops wanna cuff me, do it
You wanna be a hero, snuff me, do it, rush me, do it
Shit, like I ain't been through the scars and bruises
Like I ain't been through the bars, seen the sergeant troopers
Look at my body, I lost so much weight
Cops raiding my spot, I done lost so much weight
I'm telling Papi ""front me a brick, let me owe that cake""
He telling me he ain't got but so much weight
He been waiting for his connection to come
I'm like ""at least give me a half, I'll compress it and stretch it to one""
I'm on the block as usual
With that block that you chop and the rocks as usual
Watching for the cops that's moving through
Me and my soldiers know the rules to use ‘case we get bopped by the dudes in blue
We use cakes to get by, by the dudes in blue
Keep your mouth locked, screwed and glued
Or shots from the Ruger duke'll circle round your body like hula-hoops (woo!)
Mami told me son, hold your own
And one day you gon' grow to be a rolling stone
I believed her...
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me...

Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats

May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return

Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church!"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine

At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve

The Liberation of Lonzo Williams,rap,The Coup,1993,851,{},"[Verse 1 - Boots Riley (and E-Roc)]
1986 a motherfucker doing tricks in the mix and I don't mean the fader
Face of zits but getting grits with black steel firesticks
Trying to build an Empire something like Darth Vader
Now Lonzo was armed with nothing but a mean mug
(But tucked a forty-five, with forty-five slugs)
He was a jitterbug thug, at the dance, cuttin a rug
(Treatin his sisters like a hooker) Greetin his partners with a hug
Breakdown shakedown, this brother would take pounds
Of soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protected wads of gorgeous green
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a ki
Rocks were cookin but he's lookin for a way to be free
Here's a ki (there's a ki) but Lonzo, where's yours?
There's no key to the door, but there's money on the floor
(So stoop down) bend over (hurry pick it up fast)
But watch out, Lonzo -- YOU'LL GET FUCKED IN THE ASS

[HOOK]
[Verse 2 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
Knock knock (who is it?) time to visit but it's two years late
Cause Lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
He's got some fat ends, got some more friends, (and a brand new Benz)
He's got respect and he suspects that it won't end
A couch is still a couch (and a chair is still a chair)
But a house is now a crackhouse, Luther, Lonzo's there
Dying brains, dying bodies, taken from these dead residence
Trying in vain to kill their pain, exchanging dead presidents
Many bourgeoise parlez francoise (I don't speak it but I know it)
It's all the same (the business game) but you go to jail for this shit
We were tribal our survival was now based on stoppin rivals
Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists, I can't survive and not be ruthless
(So while we scrape, and scratch for bones
And a cellular phone, somebody's sittin on the throne
Cause they don't let, black folks own)
THEY JUST GIVE US THIS SHIT ON LOAN, KICK IT

[HOOK]

(Ahaha, yeah, what was I fidna say?
Aww yeah Lonzo's back in the County, man)
Damn we'll go visit him on Sunday when we visit Dee, aight?

[Verse 3 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
(Madge says that Bounty is the quicker-picker-upper)
Well Lonzo says the County is the slip-up, trip-up, stuck-up
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
Makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
(But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
On my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve)
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, but dig it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ""Here's the ticket""
(Now he's addicted) to learnin how we been afflicted
And what distributin that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, ""Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob"" (You had a government job)
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
(Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night)
Now he hangs with us for revolutionary ruckus
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us
Just cause we know the road to riches is crooked and narrow
We'll get more power from a hundred thousand gun barrels",646,en,en,en

Got ya' hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, whining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention

I don’t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

And plenty honey’s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees

From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys

Now raise up out your seat, Dre’s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers

Imagine that a few years back I was bagging cracks
Magnum gats playing street corners, committing savage acts

We all are falling when we think we all are rising
We pop Cris' on the horizon, topless chicks with thick thighs and
I rather be civilizing, enterprising, improvising
Temperature rising, Elohim gave me the guidance
Told me, ""Leave those 85ers alone, blend with the wise men""
That bought 80 G stones, twin Mercedes on homes
Fuck it, just spend 10 G alone on chrome
When I die they'll take my chromosomes and clone clones

See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggas I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change

Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed

She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggas to slow to cope
& though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth & days
& though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's ""Doe or Die"" till I'm dead

I played all positions, plus learned from each mission
Politic wit all type niggas wit different diction
I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up
Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up
But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by
Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry
So play the game, other slow up change the lane
Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain
It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures
They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures
Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating
Or play a part of them investigating
It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing
Unknowing first time felons on trial blowing
So burn your clips and sit back, learn your shit

Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up

We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?

Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game

No doubt, time to mellow out, party at the yellow house
Yell it out, invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laid back with the Alizé, millis concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit, stressed out, supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, squeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizarre nights, move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing, knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that choose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low-keying
Me and the crew in the gold BM ODing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice Vs
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning Ls
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill-natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of Satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs

Attract women, low fade, waves laid and spinning
Stay paid four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep
These cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth
Trying to stay sane amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message involved remained plain
Poor advice given, we all strive for nice living

Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen

Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth

See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do
[Chorus]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'
[Skit]
C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just g— bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
Are we gettin' close, huh?
It's right over here
You sure it's Biggie Smalls crib, man?
Yeah, I'm sure, motherfucker, come on
Man, fuck, this better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck, right here

- Alright, well I'm with you, gimmie your number
- No doubt, no doubt
- Here go my number right here
[Verse 1]
You know the happenings, homies just yappin' and
Hand shaking, laughing, and exchangin' all they math again
You usually lose touch when you travelin'
A few dudes bruised up in the battlin'
Parked on Madison across from the Radisson
We talked about the tattlin' some niggas did in Maryland
Plus discussed old homicides unravelin'
I asked, was he dabblin', he laughed and said he managin'
His Carti frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Oprah's mouth
In other words, I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird, 'fore I'm up and out
Without a sound, snatched my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound and told him, ""Homie, hold it down""

[Hook]
You know the game insane in the brain
Big things in the Range, real niggas never change
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
So through the fame, through the fire and the flames
I adapt to the pain, real niggas do the same
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
[Verse 2]
It was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him
Woke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be doggin' for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep callin'
Up in Nordstrom's for a fresh pair to floss 'em
Of course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport 'em
Caught 'em before the salesmen even had time to assort 'em
Bought 'em before any celeb stylist ever saw 'em
Wore 'em soon as I copped 'em in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination, lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rockin', I answered, what's poppin'
They answered and said, they shot him, now the hood got a problem
I had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle
Tryin' to figure what nigga, why and by who, then
Before you know it, the other voice told it
It was homie from the old clique I just seen and spoke with

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's Doe or Die, we survive 'till we slain
And it's no surprise, homie was probably high when they came
I know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name
Godly trained, he could camouflage on any terrain
Carti frames, we go back like Bartles and James
It's a shame cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchalantly I refrained cause it constantly changed
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why didn't they go for the chain
If they just wanted some news they could've left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged

And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Comin' through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got 'em in the zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?
Imagine if I was dude and hittin' cats from the back
With no strings attached, yeah nigga, picture that
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt
Ay yo, yo, yo, come here so I can bust in ya mouth

Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y

(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remy down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin': ""Yeah baby, I love you long time""
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said ""Whoa! Who's the other guy?
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye""
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth: ""Fool, Give me my money!""
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars

You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome 4 that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen:
""Good night friend, 'til we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again""
Uh, I never front like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend, if they could, they'd kill me, friend
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on

They call me Mr. Please-Believe-It, believe it please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease

Y'all the type of players that be getting two-day contracts
E-mail snitch got Ds in your two-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans with the deuce trey on back
The Street Family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July and we had on Woolrich's
I got them teflons, to shove in the 4
That have undercovers and po', recovering slow
The government know, the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow

I keep the streets so numb they call me ""Novocaine""
I turn over 'caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele
I could lose it all today, be back the next day
Still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures: down, up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime: snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, Pusha-Ton
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holding, whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central

Hovered and govern the corner you hugged then I shuffle you roadie

Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

Killa! (Killa!), Dipset, man
Ayo you know I've been all over the motherfucking world, man
But ain't no place like Harlem, man
Let me break it down, man

[Verse 1]
We tie dynamite to the rhino type, wino might find yo' sight
Sell the information for a dime of white, that China-China
I'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor-miner
Elder fella; looking for that shine? I'll shine ya
My mind designer. You a dime? I'll dine ya
Madonna momma, body bottled, you're fine. I'm finer
Time to climb her, climb behind vagina
Then I hymen-grind her 'til her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her; vision's gone, kiss her palm
Turn her arm, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is raw
""Gotta get it right ma, we gon' get along""
Said ""how?"" ""don't trip,"" but, yo, the trick is wrong
First visi-on, day job tick-a-tron
Nighttime, Mr. Mom, bootleg Cris' and Dom
Brother Chris and Don, and their sister Carm
They sell yay', you'll say ""yay, this shit's the bomb""
I'ma hit my man, tell 'em you my pick upon
The rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom
You know, kiss his mom, she gave him wisdom charm
And their father come from a long list of dons
And I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful, it's tearful
Told my mother I hustle and she said ""be careful""
[Chorus]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world (Killa!)

[Verse 2]
Everybody like, ""Cam got the recipe now!""
Not them 3 girls, I got to be Destiny's Child (gotta be me)
Specially equities, reckon we smile
Interfere, tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile
Detective deceptive, receptive of fouls
Hectic, Heckler & Koch
Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah, I ain't gonna be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog
I broke bread with the whale, fled from some seals (what else?)
And the house, I was the head of the hills, shit
You get a dumb ho, and get dumb-happy
Go to the gun show, get gun-happy (who are we?)
Stuck, killed, mugged, milled
Tone, flint, sticks, bo, Chub's milk (what up, y'all)
Pucci baba, but I got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel, nigga (nigga)
Ya, we'll just clap up your brains, snatch up your chains
See dog? Rap is my aim
But I'm a hustler, in my heart, trapped is the game
Attached to my frame, tapped to my brain, the fact still remains:
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, don't be asking for Dame, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
And anyway, homeboy, you a grown-ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchline (not at all)
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time
If they find that stash box just one time
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the truck
Side of the road, holding you up, you cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine
Take my chances one-on-one with the K9
Steel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips
Fuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the Dips (Killa, Killa!)

Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?

Doctor C

[Verse 1]
Yo, I plan to build myself a facility before I'm forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon-14's
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name, bombard your brain
With gamma X-rays 'til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
It's like trying to ride a bull
Let's have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice Cedars-Sinai room
So I can get sick as the flu, spittin' the truth
If you ain't got this album, you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the Moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood
Motherfucker you didn't win 'cause I can't lose
Give the fans the chance to choose, fuck you!
Who's the illest? Who's it really up to?
Rapping fire, you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
'Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis ain't dope, you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris, Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker, my great grandfather was Irish
Let's roll the dices, I'll break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man, I don't need no hype man
Put a thousand on me, put one on him
I tear off his limbs, throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo, I soak that sugar-coated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss, turn that noise off
Call Detroit's Mafia Boss
Tell him, ""Yo, I got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls""
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
I'm the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood, sweat, and tears, sucking it up
Yo, you wonder where I am right now?
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive, Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin' divine, you can't get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C, Ph. D, graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you can't see
Butcher on Broad Street, wrapping CD's
In butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies
If you don't like the quality, then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep?
Punching the keys, remember that sound
That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth
Kick a rap, bitch, if you've got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me, I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man, double the beef
To tell you the truth, I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside, blah blah, et cetera et cetera

To the man behind the zipper, and then I flip her
You could ask the strippers, I'm a very good tipper

Brooklyn Go Hard,rap,JAY-Z,2008,261382,{Santigold},"[Intro: Santigold]
Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn
Brooklyn, we go hard
We go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Go hard)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Better look on map
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' use to
Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Please! Tell me what the name of this shit

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aw, man—I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

[Verse 3: Santigold]
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head

Juicy,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1994,3528473,{},"[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)
Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun-testin', coke-measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga deceased
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nothin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore (say what?)
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shoppin', buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?

I don't know
The fuck wrong with you, bitch?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh, no, that's not my steelo

Packin' gats in a Coach bag, steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, ""What you talking 'bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fucking fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...

[Verse 2: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga, stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kickin' down your goddamn door
And it goes a little something like this

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it

Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in ICU
I'm lifted, troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentleman, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens, bitch

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G. & Method Man]
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my MAC unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus

And I ain't ask for an estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya' see I'm nothing like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin'
Y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the Benny washed
It's Deja Vu, like Denny Wash
The budgets too big, Billionaire’ll hurt a label
Play it tight spray the creed on the Purple label
Pave' set me and Jacob got me linked up
The bentley wag' bullet proof, like a Brinks truck
CVL, we dont care what ya homies sell
Rubberbands round' the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a ho sweeter than Damita Jo
She act conceited, though, her number get deleted, yo
I'm not a musician, but I play an instrument
The raging bull handle any kind of incident
The Black latex D’s can't get the prints
The Flying Spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initials on the door scrappy
Initials on the floormats
I ain't braggin', homeboy, this my format
The 22’s look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man so I need the Lambo station
Slick talk'll put a chamber into rotation
Directors style I shoot 'em on location
My hoes Haitian, Trini and Croatian
Ass clap louder than a Oprah ovation

Her shoe game's at a nine hundred a pair level
I'm in P-rada the color of Ri-cotta
Cheese? Please, you can't tell me nada
I don't share keys nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on River Road
Then I switched up, posted on Palisade
The Denali stay smellin' like Cali grade
A couple Bond Number 9 squirts
Osama Rich--that's the hard-to-find shirt
Your rocks keep to they self? Well mines flirt
They too clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch and I'm screamin' it like Ashy Larry
They call me Brinks boy. Maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubber bands pop you gon' need a scrunchee for me
If she a jumpoff, bet the chick bungee for me
I came a long way and I still stroll the avenues
Move in style, Louis V, rollin' travel
Local nigga, you never been to Poland have you?
So you couldn't judge me if you was holding gavels
And I used to get the raw from Bolivia
That was back when Raven Simone was Olivia
I did the take out, meaning that I ran orders
I had the transporters sittin' by the land borders
The Rockefeller make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in juniors, comin' home with granddaughters
So homie if you got a weapon, tote it
You can't jump ship niggas won't accept you boat it
When I was doin it for TV I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas tryna' final episode it
A half a clip in ya hip'll make ya Elvis shake
You'll more than moan when the bones in ya' pelvis break

Ten Crack Commandments,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1997,1144477,{},"[Chuck D]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

[Intro]
It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

[Verse]
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number Two: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number Three: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number Four: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number Five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em, ""Bounce!""
Number Six: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back? Shit, forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number Eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number Ten: a strong word called 'consignment'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say, ""Hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks, she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off
And quick to speed off on the Jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin' money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin' the state
I'm like O. from The Wire, walk with a sawed-off and a .8
And I was taught, never talk with a snake
When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin and wake
Get you wrapped up, and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck with niggas, if they soft or they fake
Only jail cats, and niggas going back and forth to court could relate
Fuck with me, and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl that specialize in torture and rape

That ran to the cops, to bring the tips of the last names (Nigga!)
Like I ain't bring the shipments, and pass 'caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips with the grass stains (Nigga!)
Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast Range (Nigga!)
Like I ain't sling on stips, 'til my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came (Nigga!)
Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped and my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dames
I'm why you stay in touch with ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen, and start clutchin' it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter
But I know, everything about rollin' up, like a Dutch and a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter
One hit'll have the fiends yellin' out, they need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch or indict us, and the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga

The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice!

That when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes, and you wanna beef

I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eatin' off rap, that same feat you think you capable of
Don't get me wrong, I would like to dead it
But you actin' like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck with my head

A bad ho and a plate of salmon, smoking and drinking

Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground 'cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell

We gon' make it, we gon' make it

I seen Mase do it, I seen 'Ye do it
'X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
Fifty came through like hurricanes do
I thought I finished his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli,"" Fifty did a milli
'Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade"": fucking awesome

What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92 (Uh-huh)
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate

Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous

And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far-away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad daylight—go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him!
Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!

You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill

Like smoking the thinnest air

Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers

And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower

Bitch, I want my mother fuckin' money back
You only gave me five dollars!
I gave you twenty mother fuckin' dollars!
No, you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
No, I gave you twenty and I ain't gon' sit here and argue with your flat-ass face, home girl
This is America!
You know, that's the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home!
I ain't goin' no where 'til I get my mother fuckin' change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change
*Speaking Japanese*
*Mocking Japanese*
I want my mother fuckin' change!

[Verse 1]
What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

[Verse 2]
If I die my niggas
Fuck it, I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces, middle finger up, fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
[Interlude: Radio Interview]
(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
""I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs""
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, so, I mean, I just-I-I got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The protégé of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me

Yeah, keep it realer than most
Marcy, Brooklyn... yeah

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?

Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?

What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

Don't make Push' Russian Roulette ya
Gamble with ya life
Change came from cocaine I've measured
White was the treasure, comfort was the steelI pedal to the corner like a child on a big wheelFlow more sicker, so much shake in the street
They measure my weight in Richter
Make no mistake, I rhyme for the public
But still I push yay that make the ghettos quakeBy all means I've seen I've lived
By 22 years old, 50 thousand dollar vehicles I rimmedMy dreams start over the stoveI ran over the globe and back again
You seen em, five-ten, hair swingin, dark skinned
Gun on my hip like a sergeant
Wrist Green Power, Chris Tuck' in my watch
Anytime the small hand move, it's Rush Hour

Homie you don't want no probs wit us
Cause we the type of dudes who don't think when we bustYou die (Eghck!)

I offer y'all, 24 bars of rawLike eight balls in hard or soft

This the same game got my brother strung out
So I, count the ways that it fucked up his life
So I don't have a problem with upping my price, uhAnd who said the game ain't fair?
A God damn loser!
Look, just like chicks, them cats they be runnin' they lips
Worried to death am I still in the Clipse
Well, here's a secret bout me and the Clipse
Even in my absence I'm still the shit ya dig?!
Everything doing it big, from the cars to the home
From the cash to the chrome, they can't say the game ain't grown
Did they tell you bout the nine? I keeps me that
And I don't ever fall off like Adebisi HatWhen times get tight, the coke game like riding a bikeYou heavy as me? Not in your life. Hang it up

See me in a gold Hummer
With two ??? bitches that makes ???
Somebody touch them, then I'm a bust them
Both hoes is accustomed
To getting coke through customs
They ain't' the average women would cut them
Trey Eighters out the leather blazerPoint 'em at your Chevy BlazerThen bust holes in your Pelle blazerYou 'bout to ride in Hell's elevator
You got somethin' else to say to God?
You gonna have to tell him later
Time is money
Doubt none of y'all find this funny
See I ain't got time for dummies
So I keep the Nina Ross right beside the tummyAnd I'm leavin' with the scratch and the finest bunnyI'm so far from a million dollars
If y'all feel me, holler
Put your drinks in the air, then peel your collar
Chrome wheel Impalas
Make 'em bounce for FAM-LAY
Cuz your drunk ass might get killed tomorrow
Narcs jumpin' out of U-Haul trucks
Leavin' you all stuck
Behind a park bench, balled-up
So I sleep all day, hustle all night
Like a vampire
But I don't suck blood, I bust slugs
Liquor got me trigger-happy
I can tell that you a hater how you lookin' at me
Young boy, but I'll pop

Kill the first

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans

This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
For all my Doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition in
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said ""Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?""
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard!""
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, ""oh no""
I went back in, ""I forgot my Indo!""
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through a (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset
She said, um:
[Bridge: Nancy Fletcher]
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from me

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!""
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, ""What was goin on?""
I tried to break it up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""
She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin' my dick

And saying ""Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay""
And on and on and on she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said ""Cheer up!"" and I gave her a hit
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""
She said, ""No you're not!"" then she starts cryin'
I says I'm 19, she says, ""Stop lyin!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

Guess who's bizzack?
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme, I was cooking them O's (cooking them O's)
Like horseshoes, I was tossing them O's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow (recycle the flow)
I'm emotional, I hug the block (ay)
I'm so emotional, I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
About the scrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa (yup)
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles, been killin' em ever since
It pays to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang (ay)
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All the gangstas in the street, they be doing they thang (ay)
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Buy 18 the hard way (let's get it)
Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play (chea)
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood, dog...the shit ain't fun (nope)
So I suggest you don't play with my chains
I'll send these hollows atchya, let em play with ya brain (that's right)
The streets is watching, the name is warm
The product's white, a star is born (yeeaah)
And I'm so fly, if I take this parachute off, I might fall and die (damn)
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex (yeah)
Then we ship it out of town, call it safe sex (ay)

More than a hustler, I'm the definition of it
Master chef, Lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homie, it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks, the whole world's 'bout to hear me out
See, I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money, my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z Blue
Don't follow me, young'un, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo'
I was at my video, Cris' on the speedboat
In My Lifetime, nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas, my nigga, that was me first
Chrome-shoe'd the GS, I came feet-first
In the game like a baby born to breech birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start bugging 'cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like ""Nah Hov', talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z!""
See I'ma '80s baby, master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, every day is college
You ain't did nothing I ain’t did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I spray Llamas still
The time'll reveal, you know I'm being honest
Ya ain’t pull my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades 'cause your boy that bright
Goodnight!

See, don't consider these niggas your friends. I mean, you might not want even to call them associates. I heard y'all after I went down. Like ""Dram's done."" ""You're supposed to do it the right way."" What is the right way, nigga? Oh I didn't help the game out? Oh, ok. Kill yourself!

[Fabolous in the background]
For all of ya'll I know you're feeling yourself
Yeah going against me is like killing yourself nigga
Suicide it's a suicide, suicide it's a suicide

[Verse - Fabolous]
How you want it, in the abdomen or back?
Cause enemies poke you from the front, friends stab you in the back
The same niggas who trying to collab you on the track
But turn right around and try to crab you on the smack
Through the ups and downs I just try to stay level-headed
I hear a lot of bullshit but I never sweat it
Cause when you ask 'em 'bout it, They goin' say they never said it
They know if it's beef I let the Mac-11 dead it
And when I spit you could dig it like a shovel said it
You couldn't hear a hotter flow if the devil said it
I walk by 'em and wink
I don't feel T's Pain cause I never had to buy him a drink
Double shot of Loso baby, I am the drink
Tell em lay down on the couch baby, I am the shrink
I bring your lady home, but I got the 80 chromed
Niggas go Tom Cruise crazy for the Katie Holmes
I know niggas living in the Fed
Who say don't look down unless she giving you some head
I'm driven by the bread, my push is the paper
I roll up like kush in the paper
I gotta be Kobe, you never see niggas like Smush in the paper
Unless he got pushed in the paper
So my niggas be on some bullshit, I call them the ""Heat sweepers""
They ride around with the street sweepers
They murk you at the Grammys, but they kill you in the streets cheaper
Either way you 6 feet deeper
It's Loso, a.k.a the 1 Trump Plaza suite creeper
King size, double-G Gucci sheet sleeper
The kid blow shots, catch me in the kid robot
5 in the jersey, cause the kid so hot
Similar to Jason, you point at the guard/God
You must got an appointment with God
A meeting with Allah, or maybe a hot date with Satan
Niggas is food, I got hot plates for hating
So when they bring the name up, They goin' say I came up
That shit alone be burning these fucking lames up
Come through in a Bentley, just to turn the flames up
So you wanna take a shot? Nigga better aim up
Loso top shelf, Nigga I'm the betta liquor
Ain't goin' nowhere for a while, you could get a Snicker
I fuck her quick, get her quicker
Ma momma said keep your tongue in your mouth unless you a letter licker
I'm getting money bitch, but I ain't a cheddar tricker
Got the Texas toast meaning that my bread is thicker
As a young'n I was too cool to sweat a whore
Now I'm fuckin pretty bitches with them good credit scores
Nigga with mental loss can't forget I been a boss
Trying me is like bungeeing with dental floss, fucker",72,en,en,en

Blueprint, trois
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
What we talkin' 'bout? Real shit or we talkin' 'bout rhymes?
You talkin' 'bout millions or you talkin' 'bout mine?
What we talkin' 'bout? 'Cause I ain't got time
For what people be talkin' 'bout all the time
What we talkin' 'bout? Fiction or we talkin' 'bout fact?
You talkin' 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talkin' 'bout life (Life, life)
And all I hear is, ""Oh yeah, he keeps talkin' 'bout crack""
I ain't talkin' 'bout profit, I'm talkin' 'bout pain
I'm talkin' 'bout despair, I'm talkin' 'bout shame
I ain't talkin' 'bout gossip, I ain't talkin' 'bout Game
I ain't talkin' 'bout Jimmy, I ain't talkin' 'bout Dame
I'm talkin' 'bout real shit, them people playin'
What is you talkin' 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talkin' 'bout, ""Hov, take it back!""
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothin' cool 'bout carryin' a strap
'Bout worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
I'm talkin' 'bout revenge while carryin' his casket
All teary-eyed, 'bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' 'bout music, I ain't talkin' 'bout rap
You talkin' 'bout who's hot, I ain't talkin' 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map

They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
I see what y'all talkin' about, ha ha
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Chyeah, still they can't focus on them, they be talkin' 'bout me
Talkin' 'bout what I wear, talkin' 'bout where I be
Yeah, check out my hair, these ain't curls, these is peas
Peasey head still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' 'bout progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track, try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' 'bout Hov left 'em flat
Tryna rewrite history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men, want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard, now get off my sack—scream at me!

They talk, we live
We see what they say, they say, they say
They talk, we did
Who cares what they say, they say, they say?

And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could choose to sit in front of your computer
Posin' with guns, shootin' YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House, get your suit up
You stuck on being hardcore, I chuck the deuce up
Peace out Medusa
Welcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Tooter of my own horn, beep beep, moo ya

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'

Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, ""There go Mase!"", there go your cutie

Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops

Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way

Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yea, yea, yea

Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!

And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig? (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Jim Jones, [?] & Cam’ron]
We fly high, no lie (You hear that?), you know this (Let’s ride... Ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside (Yessir!), it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly (Ballin’), no lie, and you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Ya boy gettin' paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
Eight fly rides just to drive in my garage (Choose one!)
Stay sky high (Twisted), fly with the stars (Twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (Flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (Do it!)
I hopped out, saggy jeans and my rock glistened (Ballin'!)
But I spent about 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!"" (Do it!)

I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got ‘em)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks to last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM, we was at the club (What happened?)
2 AM, ten bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And by 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car due to drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

You talkin’ buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)
But of course gotta fly the Spur ([?])
To the hood and roll dice on side the curb (I got bank)
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (Speedin', speedin’)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyle rich, famous, livin' in the fast lane (Ballin', ballin’)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back

When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther

In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides

While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass

Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

Took 13 South, cross the Bay Bridge with it
Ring the triangle, dinner bell, come and get it!
The time in the kitchen, I dare not mention
When my cell phone echo, I swear they listening
'89 was my beginning y'all
Young snot-nosed, stashed yams in a tennis ball
Cops swore we was playing catch, no!
We was adding stretch, no choice, beg 'til you outta breath
I ducked the Feds, they seeing my weight grow
Streets love Malice for his comeback ratio
If they got popped, we made sure they made bail
Cause if not, we be scared they gon tell
Patty cake, that's me, bake the pies
Pyrex, mixed that, scrape the sides
Grindin, Glock-9 in the lining
May God strike a nigga dead if he lying

Rain,rap,Chamillionaire,2005,6725,"{Scarface,""Billy Cook""}","[Talking]
I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
They told me that pain was just in the brain, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's right behind me with a Gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To help with the time I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being poor, yeah, trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see the 3 of your tires that be on flat
And that one tire left's a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure up around your folk
That keeps you from trying to wrap a rope around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you ""hear you boy"", but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back for what
So the pastor can ride faster, get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, the problems come back around
Damn
[Hook - Billy Cook]
Keep your head up is what they telling me, what it gotta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me, rain drops round up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me, don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me, till my heaven gets cloudy bout a memory

[Verse 2 - Scarface]
God knows how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow? Or if I run, am I missing something?
I took the time out to save a little bread
Now my eyes got water in 'em
Why the fuck am I still standing here?
Nobody love me, I ain't happy here
My mama said she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
The devil's speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirited demonic person everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, watching out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces?
Let it rain
[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to lift as much as me partna
(Could tell you stay strong) you're trying, but help is just what you doubting
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don’t let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah — 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That’s what they telling me
I’m trying to focus on the road that’s ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Are raining in on your bright, sunny day

Should be a celebration, of life",129,en,en,en

Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? You can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl, ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Come on, come on

I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

One More Chance / Stay With Me Remix,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1995,583928,"{""Faith Evans""}","[Intro: Faith Evans]
Don't go, don't go, don't go (Baby, don't go)
I love you, so (One more chance)
Biggie, give me one more chance (One more chance)
Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
First thing's first — I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get Nathan but penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb — never
Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop it — if you think you gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, gon' see my guns — get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two, as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya
I'm clockin' ya, Versace shades watchin' ya
Once ya grin, I'm in — game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
In diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate
From the back, I get deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break, uh
[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Baby, here I am
I got that good love girl, you didn't know?
All I need is one more chance! One more chance
I can help you find, yourself
I got that good love girl, you didn't know?
'Cause you don't need nobody else
One more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She's sick of that song on how it's so longgggg
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is! Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl 'round me!
True playa for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me ""Meet me at twelve""
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, payin' car notes?
While I'm swimmin' in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nothin' left to do but send her home to you
I'm through, can you sing the song for me, boo?
[Chorus: Faith Evans & (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, give me one more chance
One more chance
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, give me one more chance
One more chance

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion — flyin' into all states
Sexin' me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the playa President

[Chorus: Faith Evans & (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, give me one more chance
One more chance
One more chance
Baby, here I am

Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks (What?)
Sex, murder and mayhem; romance for the street (Uh-huh)
Only wife of mines is a life of crime, and since
Life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death? That's
That's life's enigma, long as life within us
We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us, fuck it
Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture (Uh-huh)
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: ""Money, cash, hoes"", how real was that nigga? (What)

Flavors robust, platinum and gold touch
Yeah I rap now, fast money done slowed up
Niggas try to stop Jay-Z to no luck
Roc-A-Fella forever, CEO, what! (what?)
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings
While y'all playa hate we in the upper millions
What's the dealings? (huh) It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they gon' criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song
Bed-Stuy Brook-Nam took on the world
Shit, I led a life you can write a book on
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller, what!

D-M-X and my dogs bite
Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night
Thugs for life, one night with this rap shit
Let 'em go and I bet they know what'll happen
When we clap shit
Acting like we owe 'em something
Then we show 'em something
Talking greasy, I think they found 'em down the road or something (Wooh) Fucking with a mad man in a bad mood
Is like fucking with a mad dog that wants mad food
And the only thing that's stopping him is you (WHAT!)
So the only thing that he'll be dropping is you (WHAT!)
Chopping in two (COME ON!)
Then he drop it to Clue, and the response from the street:
This is one dog that loves raw meat (woo!)
But getting back to, just 'cause I, love my niggas
I shed blood, for my niggas
Let a nigga holla, ""where my niggas?""
All I'ma hear is ""right here my nigga!""

Making hot songs
But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z
Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z
But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what
Not selling any records, fuck you pay me
Oh you want me in your video, fuck you pay me
No one's coming to your shows huh, fuck you pay me
And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label?
You can't sell any singles in the stores?
You light a match....you blow the joint *explosion*",88,en,en,en
N.Y. State of Mind,rap,Nas,1994,1931190,{},"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Have you ever loved somebody who used to get the party poppin'
We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot
We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the Roc
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates? (I miss you)

I never seen pain like your parents' pain

But they not original and they not identical
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
I swear, in hip-hop, if it's not ten of you

Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same

It's Kells!
Haters start your engines!

[Verse 1]
4'5'', looking fly
F-f-flossing in that white L.I
Shawty checking for a player
Like she wanna hop in with a player

Girlfriend on some hatin' shit
She like: ""Shit, that's Kells, bitch!”
And then I stop like red light
Scooped em up like hitch-hike
Then I let them come with me
Step up in club with one on each sleeve
Doug E. Fresh kid bout to spend that cheese
And after that you know they gonna leave with me
We out of here, get them to the crib
Straight to the mansion, show em how I live
And you can tell that the sex is major
Cause only one day later

They got Kells on they ringtone
I hear Kells on they ringtone
They got Kells on they ringtone
Hold up your phone if you got me on your ringtone!
Hold up your phone if you got me on your ringtone!

Let me take you shopping, babe
Meet me right by Macy's, babe
Leave your purse, I'm crazy babe
Walk in and go crazy, babe

I'm telling you money ain't a thing to me
Kells ""spin"" it on you like wheels on Jeeps
Even after the mall to the Ritz we creep
Sex: put it on you like shoes on feets
Money stacked, club hoppin'
Leaning back, b-b-beat droppin'
All night, non-stoppin'
Club closed we p-p-parking-lottin'
Y'all going to the spot from here?

Is there an after party after this?
(Yes sir!)
Are y'all taking them honies with?
(Yes sir!)
Are y'all on for some more freaky shit?
(Yes sir!)

You play me in your car and you play me in your home
Now it's time to download Kells on your ringtone
From ghetto girls, college girls, all the way to strippers
To fine dro smokers and all the Henny sippers
Big chip spenders, big money tippers
At the bar taking shots with my niggas
No fake niggas, no hating niggas
But shots of Patron for all my real niggas

And they ain't leaving til six in the mornin'

Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

That's why all I want is you now

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, ""I’m wrong"", you say, ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will

Rise  Fall,rb,Craig David,2003,49444,{Sting},"[Chorus: Sting & (Craig David)]
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writings on the wall
Superstar, you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (Over)
And it seems as though the writings on the wall (Yeah)
Superstar, you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

[Verse 1: Craig David]
I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before may go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
'Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (Over)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (Yeah)

But once your picture becomes tainted

The rise and fall

[Verse 2: Craig David & (Sting)]
I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews, no pictures
Endless demands (Endless demands)
Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart?

[Chorus: Sting & (Craig David)]
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (Mm yeah, over, mm yeah)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (The writing's on the wall, yeah)
Superstar, you finally made it (Oh yeah)
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call (It's what they call)
The rise and fall (The rise and fall)
[Bridge: Craig David]
Now I know (Now I know)
I made mistakes (Made mistakes)
Think I don't care?
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have
Just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be
Used to be

[Chorus: Sting & (Craig David)]
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (Over)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (The writing's on the wall, yeah)
Superstar, you finally made it (Ooh)
But once your picture becomes tainted (Oh yeah)
It's what they call (It's what they call)
The rise and fall (The rise and fall)
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (You know you know, over)
But it seems as though the writings on the wall (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, ""Keep it drama free""
Woah-woah
(Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Yeah, yeah, told you that I'm leaving, deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Woah, woah
I know you mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to somethin' better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye)
[Verse 2: Tyga, Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, oh-oh, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (Say bye-bye)
[Verse 3: Kevin McCall, Chris Brown]
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better (Better, baby)
No more tryna make it work, hey (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)

Craig David, Mos Def, and Premo
When we step on the mic we too cold
This remix might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def a.k.a. Yaasin Bey]
Now look alive and clap your hands to it
Sexy mamis in the house, shake and dance to it
My hard head's in the place - don't act stupid
It's not Craig and Big Mos can't do it
Get that ass moving, from the front to back to it
Putting that thumping back to it
It's that music to set it off and get the mass movin
Yo tell them 'bout that shorty you came through with

[Craig David]
I met this girl in the subway, walking my way
It must have been my day
Seem like the perfect match for me, so she said to me
""Craig can you give me what I want?
I don't know about you, but I feel so good..""
Girl I can make you feel real hot tonight
So I said baby we can do it in the pouring rain
Do it again do it again till you call my name
Girl you got me insane
Can't maintain the speed in the fast lane
Or we can do it on the telephone, make you moan
Make you groan, all night long, yeah
Or we could do it on the down low, or when you're all alone

Cause it was ""ooh"" on Monday
And it was (two!) on Tuesday

Gave her what she wanted through to Sunday

Come a little closer, gimme a twirl
Put my hands on your body cause you're on my mind
On my mind, think about you all the time
Girl can you give me what I want?
I don't know about you but I feel so hot
I want to love you baby
Do all the little things that I want to do
Or we can do it in the pouring rain
Do it again, do it again, til you call my name

Listen, little mamma you can kill all the drama
Girl you know you gonna be here til tomorrow
Probably stay after that, later on and maybe play after that
Get it on and lay straight after that, it's like an natural fact
When you see me you know how to react
It don't matter anywhere that we at it's game time
Move your waistline shook your tail further to the bassline
Moving in the same time like we got the same sign
Peep game, it's pro ball I'm pretty laced to my part
I go off like Biz Mark
Yeah I talk big talk but carry a big staff
And stay down for laying it down your big ass
I'm know I'm wrong, but damn ma I got to tell for true
Tell the world like I tell it to you
That's it's just a mere mention of you

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin-a?
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy, but even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that let's me know that she's a human being
And being human's hard—on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm André, Benjamin André to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx?
""Pink and Blue"", you're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'
You got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if Anita Baker brings the joy
Your kind are the Tyner, meanin' the real McCoy

Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter

Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""

But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)

And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart

But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple ""I think that we’re ready""s
Couple ""I think that we should wait""s
Are we actin' like a couple? I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes

Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'

Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in

They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

Then maybe...

When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more

Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin

From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted

But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

A lot of bread, no sesame seeds

I'm plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy
The girls want a Minaj, yeah, they wetter than a rainman
Usher, buzz me in, everybody loves Raymond

If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You go get some girls and bring them to me
If you're coming with me, really coming with me

Be my little freak, be my little freak
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak

Un-thinkable Im Ready Remix,rb,Alicia Keys,2010,282568,{Drake},"[Intro: Alicia Keys]
If you ask me, I'm ready...

[Verse 1: Drake & Alicia Keys]
Ugh, Tez keeps tellin' me he just turned 30
Havin' dreams of bein' single forever, he's gettin' worried
And I'm scared too, 'cause I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me I haven't changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
'Stead of searchin' for substance at every single party
Baby, bein' part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody that's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm tryna live right and give you whatever's left of me (yeah)
'Cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you, I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city 'til you finally decide
I've got more than a thing for you, tattoo and an ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, I'll do the unthinkable
[Verse 2: Alicia Keys & Drake]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say
You should say it right now
You should say it right now
You ready?

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I deserve it, I think I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I can't take it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I know you once said to me
""This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be""
Time is only wastin', so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it
We should do it right now
We should do it right now
Baby, uh
[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
I deserve it, I know I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah
Sing...
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...

I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it

It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

Looking out, across the nighttime

Girl, if you don't know, I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul for sure
I'm right here on my knees
If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything
[Verse 2]
You complete me baby
Don't you let, nothing come, between us, hey
Alcohol has been, my best friend
And I admit some tears, have passed my chin
Crying in the bed over you, just ain't manly
But I don't give a damn, no
'Cause I could wash these pillow cases, I could change these sheets baby
But I need you back in the crib cooking up some of that good chicken and gravy
Mash potatoes, homemade lemonade
Want you back to the old days, you been with me since I had long braids

And I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man

If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything

Girl my heart won't beat right, I can't sleep nights
Ooh you're haunting my dreams
All I know is I hold onto memories
When you touch, I touch you
When you moaning, you scream, oh baby
Girl, you know just what you do to me
I acted so stupidly
And unless you want to take away my soul, no, don't go

I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man

No baby no, don't you go away, I just, I just need time
Don't you leave me girl, don't do this

It's Plies baby, let me go tuck 'em in
My bay just called me and told me to cum put her to sleep
She said her period just went off, feel like she in heat
I been feinding for her, I couldn't touch her all week
I told her to get naked and be waiting on top of the sheets
I wanted her so bad when I've seen her I didn't have time to speak
I told her on my shoulders is where I wanna see her feet
I put a pillow behind the headboard so it wouldn't squeak
And put her hands around my waist and told her push me deep
I told her I'm gonna work with her all night until she on
I can feel her nails in my back that's how I know I'm beating
I put my ear to mouth I love to hear her breathing
I can tell she almost at her peek by the way she's screaming
I feel her wetness on my stomach and I'm the reason
She's clutching the sheets and running I'm tryna keep her even
Whispered in her ear if you don't nut I ain't leaving
She went from moaning to shaking and now she's sleeping

[Hook:]
I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna put you to bed, bed, bed

Turn you over

First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there uh

Working that 9-5 and staying cute, like you do

In the brains and the veins of my strain

From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without infanticide
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't think we in Kansas no mo' though

Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory

To Zion,rb,Lauryn Hill,1998,375471,"{""Carlos Santana""}","[Intro]
One day, you're gonna understand
Zion

[Verse 1]
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
""Look at your career,"" they said
""Lauryn, baby use your head""
But instead I chose to use my heart

[Chorus]
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)
[Verse 2]
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

[Chorus]
That the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)

Willingness to do everything for that person

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk, c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

That's what I'm talking about

[Teacher]
I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

I got what I wanted

Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, ""Don't let the high go to waste""
But can you taste a little taste?

I take it like a slap in the face
Every time the base is mentioned like I had bad intentions
Listen, I thought love was given
So for you I did those things you were missin'
Never have to say ""please gimme borrow""
As long as I got yay and two semi autos
And connects in the jets like wetback Carlos
I ain't askin' you to follow
Just think about tomorrow, please

Eyeing passers-by like you're rich but life ain't fair

Watch the coke light up they life, the rocks is stars
Had fiends talking crippled cause they locked they jaw

'Bout as cool as that breeze on the beach in Brazil
As long as fiends want 'caine then I'm gon' slang
When my financial change then I'm gon' change

Shuffling your car keys but sounded like a gentleman

Like treacherous necklaces begets etceteras
Colours coming out make your head spin like Exorcist
Spending bright futures in the hood all them no good messages

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few you would like to bone but
Chicks that romance me don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not where my plans be
Need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to Delancey to trips to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusin' me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Maybe it's the money or maybe you ain't used to me?
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusin' me
That's why I need me a girl that be true to me
Know 'bout the game and know how it do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl, it's you and me
Now let's ride
[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride with me)
I need a girl to make my wife

I need a girl to be my wife

Nobody else, she’s all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 2: Loon]
Yo, now I done met a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm gettin' money and the game gettin' deeper
Yo, on some real shit, I need somebody I could chill with (Let's chill)
I need somebody I could build with
I need somebody I could hold tight
Winter time in a full-length Snow White
Anytime we together feel so right (So right)
You the girl I been lookin' for my whole life
God, bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you, girl, now I understand life
I need a girl (I need a girl)

I need a girl to be my wife (My wife)
Nobody else, she’s all mine (Yeah)
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn, I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy's style
Shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set It Off"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
""Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!""
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—""Wham! Wham!""
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, ""Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""

I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!

Some people talk about ya like they know all about ya
When you get down, they doubt ya
And when you tip it on the scene
Yeah, they talkin' 'bout it
'Cause they can't tip on the scene
They just talk about it
T-t-t-talkin' 'bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it
[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
'Cause baby, whether you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)
Baby, whether you're high or low (High or low)

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
You gotta keep your balance or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge, but I manage 'cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage? Damn, a thought that cannot pass
See, why you don't want no friction like the back of a matchbook?
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you and your MacBook
Close shows, shut you down before we go broke backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low, we gonna get back up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Sorta like a thong in an ass crack
Come on

[Verse 4: Janelle Monáe]
I tip on alligators
And little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' 'bout it?
J-j-just talkin' 'bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner

You can't get too high (We can't get too high)

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign

I think I'll fall to pieces

Oh, I'm still in love with you

It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling

Dries all the tears from your eyes

I guess I just keep loving

I like the playettes

Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

Street knowledge by the pound

Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way

Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time

Ain't gon' let you go...

[Verse 1: Sade]
I was the one
I who could, pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet, and I gave you my love
You are the one who got me started
You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

[Chorus: Sade]
You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go...
(Ain't gon' let you go...)

You laid me down
Left me for the lions
A long long time ago
You left me there dying

But you never let me go

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I know we could have had it all
I wasn't ready to go steady, no not at all
Smoke and mirrors clouded my vision we hit a wall
Couldn't see the moon and the sky behind the fog
Pregnant, pause
Damn your baby tall, what you been up to?
I don't blame you my doll
Yeah, we kinda stalled
As God as my witness, timin' was my mistress
I guess it's in the stars for me to love you from a distance
Ah, our ship sailed, ah, the wind blows
The door's always open but our window is closed
You always thought ""What if?""
But that'll just drive you crazy baby, girl interrupted
Thinkin' 'bout what wasn't
Thinkin' 'bout what was it?
Was it somethin' I done?
Somethin' I could do better although nothin' could be done
Sometimes you get what you need
Not what you think you want
So baby no moon and sky, get a beautiful sun, uh

You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard, will stay on your mind
It ain't gon' let you go, no
'Cause you are the moon and I the endless sky

We could have had the moon and the sky

The Sweetest Thing,rb,Lauryn Hill,1997,65568,{},"The unexpected
Multi-dimensional
Unexpected sound of the Refugee All-Stars

The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Oooh, baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me

[Hook]
See like the queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known

I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone
[Hook]

It was the...Ah
I tried to explain
Ah...but baby, it's in vain

Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)

Your kisses taste like armaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

Words can make you pay and pay
Four-letter words I cannot say

Words are trouble, words are subtle
Words of anger, words of hate
Words over here, words out there
In the air and everywhere
Words of wisdom, words of strife
Words that write the book I like
Words won't find no right solution
To the planet earth's pollution
Say the right word, make a million
Words are like a certain person
Who can't say what they mean
Don't mean what they say
With a rap, rap here and a rap, rap there
Here a rap, there a rap
Everywhere a rap, rap
Rap it up for the common good
Let us enlist the neighborhood

In the rain and I'm might just hydroplane

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's
The anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
[Verse 2]
My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn it's a dead end in front of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began

Perfectly at peace

So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, ""Know what, grow up, you nasty,""
""I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me""
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

You can leave with me or you could have the blues

Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me

Give away a few Mercedes, like, here, lady, have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho

Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall

Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks

I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope

Come on put a little love here in my void,""

And what are feelings without emotions?

How could you love someone that burns you, turns you into a werewolf

Man in the Mirror,pop,Michael Jackson,1988,671106,{},"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana
[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer
[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!

You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)

Love the Way You Lie Pt. II,pop,Rihanna,2010,621101,{Eminem},"[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing

We dance to the beat of a love lost and then won back
We dance to the beat, we dance to the beat
We dance to the beat of source code and conjuring
We dance to the beat, we dance to the beat
We dance to the beat of gravity giving us a break

Last night, I had enough of you
I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard
It was all over your face
That you were slippin'
And flippin'
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a man
But you are just a bitch

You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag'

When we fell in love, you made my heart drop
And you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pear, you can call me back

But you're actin' like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not, just like that
When you grow a pear, you can call me back

When I first met you, panties droppin'
Every time I saw you, it was on and
One day you asked if we could just talk
And that's the reason why I'm walkin'
If I am honest
I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin' to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you
And you got confused

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)

Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")

But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space

Let's rock! 1! 2! 1-2-3-4!

[Verse 1]
I'm a feminine Eminem, a slim shady lady
But nice, 'cause I texted Haiti
90 lady cops in the road
And I'm arrested for doing 80
Like Hamlet, all about ""words, words, words""
Divide a whole into thirds, thirds, thirds
I'm a gay sea otter:
I blow other dudes out of the water
I'm the man muffin, diving, muffin'
Cold and fly like an arctic puffin
Puffing whacky tobaccy
Hating other rappers like I'm Helga Pataki
And I've been rocking this mic before electricity
Way back in 1000 BCE -
That's before the common era (era, era, era, era, era, era, ah)
I can't be stopped
Flow so sick that it should be mopped up
Chick's got a dixie cup
I gotta dick full of helium; I'll fuck you up
A boy, a girl, a middle aged bitch
Botox in the third person
I give the perspective a switch and
Bo talks in the third person
Ooh, just relax; if you wanna know me, here's two facts

I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypo-crite

Met a girl named Macy, had sex with her all day
But she was dyslexic, so I ended up doing the YMCA
We ballin', Asian, Wii bowling,
Prostate cancer semi-colon
Find that hole like I'm Stephen Hawking
Atticus Finch, killing, mocking
Cry like a child would
You raped my childhood
Just stroll in, roll in your pole into Rolie Polie Olie's colon
To relax my mind
I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time and
Rhyming, mathematical timing
Syntax impacts the intact hymen
I'm an internet provider
Came from the web like a horny spider
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard
Then came in cider
I thought AIDS was a butt virus
Like conjunction junction conjunctivitis
I spit gold bars 'cause I was
Molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker
Oedipus was the first motherfucker

We the people of the USA
José, we're not talking to you, esé
We got a border in order to keep you out
It's what my NYU essay's about
'Cause we're, xenophobic warrior princess
Molested by my Uncle Sam, is that incest?
""I WANT YOU"" to smell my finger
Does my nephew's scent still linger?
South of queers, north of hell
The queer ones suck and the brown ones smell
We guard the border and we guard it well
But some slip through the cracks of the liberty bell
Did I say liberty? I meant taco
Paco, hey I better let that rock go
'Cause in real life Goliath wins
And then sells all the silk that the widow spins
One more time!

Black Bentley, you look better in a pink one

Make me jump over that net between us
And let nothing get between us
We too hot, only sweat between us

I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'mma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got hard who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place

Cus I ain't gotta lie to you
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend,pop,Marilyn Monroe,1953,82881,{},"The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels

A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

Men grow cold
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end

But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't loose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Tiffany's!
Cartier!
Black, Starr, Frost Gorham!
Talk to me Harry Winston
Tell me all about it!

There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
And I think affairs
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

Diamonds! Diamonds!
I don't mean rhinestones!
But diamonds are a girl's best friend",4535,en,en,en

When we were kids
We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

Of a dying world
And millions are left behind

When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""

We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""

Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car

She stay blasting Trey and his songs

There was me and my monkey
And with his dungarees and roller blades smoking filter tips
Reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his face)
He said 'Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said 'no'
He said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a change of pace'
And we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs
He said 'I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to The Mandalay Bay Hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well?
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
'If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, then we've got a monkey bed!'

We got the elevator, I hit the 33rd floor
We had a room up top with the panoramic views like nothing you'd ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages
Called up some escort services and ordered some okey doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with three monkey whores
'Hi! My name is Sunshine - these are my girls
Lace my palm with silver baby and oh yeah, they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was diggin' old Kurt Cobain singing 'bout lithium

'What's up? You'd better get your ass in here boy, your monkey's having too much of a good

Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores, he couldn't sit still
Sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill
We went to play black-jack, kept hitting twenty three
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey? I couldn't be sure
It's not like you'd never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run

Love Is... Live,pop,Bo Burnham,2009,25815,{},"Um, so this next song is about love, appropriately

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
I love you like kings love queens
Like a gay geneticist loves designer jeans
I need you like New Orleans needs a drought
Like Hitler's father needed to learn to pull out
And I want you, yea, like a lawyer/mathematician wants some kind of proof
And I want you, yea, like JFK wanted a car with a roof
Cause love is takin' a dive
Then gettin' really comfortable and peein' in the pool
And love is real life porn minus all the stuff that makes porn cool

And love is a homeless guy searching for treasure
In the middle of the rain and finding a bag of gold coins
And slowly finding out that they're all filled with chocolate
And even though he's heartbroken, he can't complain cause he was hungry in the first place

I love you like Dora loves maps like the Pope's toilet loves holy craps
I need you like a voyeur needs a branch
Like boys tossing salad needs a little bit of Neverland Ranch
And I want you like all the Gothic kids
That look exactly the same never want to conform
And I want you like Anne Frank wanted
Nobody to read her fucking diary
Cause a diary's a collection of secret things
That no one is suppose to read thats the whole point of a diary
Millions of people have breached this little girls privacy
After she was chased by Nazis kick her while she's down

And if we met in 10000 BC I was your caveman youz my cavelady
If we got hot we'd start rubbing
If we got hungry we'd go clubbing
Theres wooly mammoths but I will protect us
You're making me devolve to a Homo Erectus. Oh

And if we met in 1780
I was a white Southern aristocratic plantation owner
And you were my dark-skinned servant lady
Slave, whenever I could get away from the misses
I'd go to your shed and then i'd steal you kisses
But let's be serious i'd still work you full time as a slave
There's a difference between romantic language
And a complete disregard for socio-economic trends

And if we met in 1941
I was a Nazi youz a Gypsy on the run
That's a little redundant
That, probably wouldn't've worked out
Because love is your favorite food for every breakfest, lunch and dinner
And love is the Holocaust if you don't die quick and you don't get thinner
And love is being the owner of the company that makes rape whistles
And even though you started the company with good intentions trying to reduce the rate of rape
Now you don't want to reduce it at all cause if the rape rate declines
You'll see an equal decline in whistle sales
Without rapists whos gonna buy your whistles
Whose gonna buy your whistles
Love is all about whistles
Thank you

Uh, that one was a bit vulgar, but uh, y'know
Dicks and vaginas are kinda like Coke and Pepsi
Uh, I strongly prefer one but my dad thinks they taste the same",5608,en,en,en

First rule, never let 'em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest (To the fullest)
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel, then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great, don't need silicone to build it, or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

High School Party Live,pop,Bo Burnham,2009,17134,{},"This next song is a, uh, first-hand account

[Verse 1]
High school party, senior year
Boys and girls they're all sipping on beer
I like soda, where’s the soda?
Am I the only fucking person here that likes soda?
I see you from across the crowd
I said the party is bumping and the music is loud
You’re really drunk and you’re looking sad
It’s like a date rape ad
Girl, then we start to dance and
Girl, baby this is romance
Girl, I’m starting to grow down below
Shit, why did I wear sweat pants?
Girl, your body's like what
Conjunction junction, that’s a fine ass but
I’m like a cashew in a lollipop
Just keeping sucking till you get to the nut
And I said let’s rob an Asian kitchen, or stroll down the block
Either way girl, we’re taking a walk/wok
You’re going to love me the way my uncle did
Except you’re not gonna to go to court for doing it
Be a guillotine or my girl instead
Either way, I said you’re giving me head
I’m gonna love you, baby, the right way
Shawty with a body looking hotty when I say
Girl
We go into the bedroom exchanging nervous laughter
Why’s it called dry humping if I always need a towel after?
You spread your naked legs and I see that wound that never healed
Even though you’re yelling for me, I can tell your lips are sealed (I've been around)
We’re both aware of my erection
You ask if I have protection
I say ""No. I mean, I tried to buy 'em once I was in the convenience store, my old baby sitter walked in, I had to hide them near the Tic-Tacs. I was so embarrassed, I peed myself a little bit.""

I should have brought my diagram
Ooh, did you feel that

New Math Live,pop,Bo Burnham,2009,62243,{},"This next song takes something that's not that fun, math
And makes it, uh, offensive...

It's new math, yeah
What's a pirate minus the ship?
Just a creative homeless guy
And an anteater plus a large hungry mutant ant?
An ironic way to die
And what's domain, domain, range?
A kid with too much in his pants
And two balls minus one
Seven titles at the Tour de France, yeah

Gets worse

Yo, split a decision with long division
Take the circumference of your circumcision
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever ya get

It's new math
It's new math
And what's a bag of chips divided by five?
Well, that's a Nike worker's meal
And Santa clause multiplied by ""i?""
Well I guess that makes him real
And the square root of the NBA is Africa in a box
How do ya trace a scatter plot?
Ya give the pencil to Michael J. Fox

Whatever

Take the approximate moral proportion of the probable problem of a pro-life abortion
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever ya get

It's new
It's new
It's new
It's new
It's new math

And if you took a factor tree of the factors that caused my girl to leave me
You'd have a tree
Full of Asian porn
C-A-L see you later
Mathematical minds make industrial smog
What's the opposite of ln(x)?
Duraflame the unnatural log
Support the farmers with a pro-tractor
Link Kennedy and Lincoln with a common factor
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever ya get

It's new
It's new
It's new
Alright, word problems, ready?

If there's a fat guy in a pastry shop with a twenty dollar bill and he's ready to buy
In order to predict his volume change you'll need to know the value of pie
And there's a metal train that's a mile long and at the very back end a lightning bolt struck her
How long till it reaches and kills the driver, provided that he's a good conductor
And if ten percent of men are gay
Twenty percent of men are Chinese
What are the odds that a man chosen at random spends his free time and mealtime while on his knees?
And if Kim is half as old as Bobby
Who is two years older than twelve-year-old Tori
For how many more 30 day months will their threesomes be considered statutory rape?

'Cause math can be sexy

'Cause having sex is like quadratic expansion
If it can't be split then its time to stop
And having sex is like doing fractions
It's improper for the larger one to be on top
And having sex is like math homework
I do it best when I'm alone in my bed
And squaring numbers are just like women
If they're under thirteen just do them in your head

Live in the light of certain
South's cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors

I’m sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV tower
I want roses in my garden bower, dig?

Royal babies, rubies must now replace
Aborted strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that’s plowed

They are waiting to take us
Into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrill-full
Comes death on a strange hour?
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest
You’ve brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven’s claws
No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it’s other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family",1333,en,en,en

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies

Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone

I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach

Shelter from the Storm,rock,Bob Dylan,1975,94063,{},"[Verse 1]
'Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 2]
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 3]
Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
[Verse 4]
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 5]
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 6]
Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
[Verse 7]
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm

[Verse 8]
I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question, then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 9]
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
[Verse 10]
Well, I'm living in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge

Cut like a jalapeño popper fart

Punched hard but it ain't like I ever cared if I went
Too far as stitches left scars from more clowns bent
Outta shape than the Cirque du Soleil ever had so

Laugh on the inside but I can hear it later

Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value

Where is your famous golden touch?""

Of all the wheels in Ivory Town
Just take a look at your body now
There's nothing much to save

""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""

Your trembling fingers to behave

And a girl with chestnut hair
And you passed the summers
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman
Oh, there were times she was just a child
And you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild
And you climbed the twilight mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere that you wandered
Love seemed to go along with you
That's a hard one to remember
Yes it makes you clench your fist
And then the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist

On a plain brown envelope
But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be written on your wrist
Along with several thousand dreams

That's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit

American you

I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, ""I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"" (Oh)

It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours

Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart

Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control

Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

What Its Like,rock,Everlast,1998,107365,{},"[Verse 1]
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
""Get a job, you fucking slob"" is all he replies

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Verse 2]
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said: ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll; I'm the man you've been dreamin' of""
But three months later he said he won't date her or return her calls
And she sweared, ""Goddamn, If I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls!""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!

God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes

I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green
I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start
[Verse 3]
I knew this kid named Max, he used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late, liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gunfight and Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose

The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days
The sight was beyond belief
Many a head snapped for double, even triple takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out
They hung out in droves
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place and that was O'Malley's Alley

The air was thick with catcalls, no pun intended
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight to behind the alleyway

You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems

And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time

Tremble for yourself, my man

Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line

I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too

And in your denim eyes, I see something's awry, and I see you're weak

Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up

I hug your bones and skin, cracklin' woods gone white, and my eyes swoll up now

Uhh
Ayo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
